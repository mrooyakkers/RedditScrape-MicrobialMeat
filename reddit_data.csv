"130";"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qc51s7/we_are_new_harvest_the_cellular_agriculture/";"Andrew here - thanks for the kind words!! If I had to guess, I would say that a product gets approval in the US within 2-3 years, since by my understanding those agencies are really interested in the field. For sale at restaurants? Probably a similar time frame (as soon as a company gets regulatory approval, they will likely partner with some restuarant and sell their product at a financial loss to get feedback, garner interest, and for marketing). For sale not at a loss at restaurants and retailers? That's where I get much less confident and usually dodge the question by saying 2-100 years. The truth is we (I) just don't have any sort of good look under the hood of these companies, and don't have a clear sense of where their tech is. I think per u/sorif's earlier question, the first products will be a hybrid plant-based cell-based product (e.g., adding 5% fat cells to a plant-based burger to improve the mouthfeel and flavor) rather than a fully cell-based meat. By doing that, you've in one stroke decreased your cost of production by a ton. Whether it gets you to a price that does well in an actual food market? I'm not sure. So I'll bring it all home and say 2-100 years.
For the last question: it'd be interesting to try some sort of animal that lives in relatively extreme conditions (ie super high pressures or extreme temperatures) and see what that does to the food. I think some arctic marine animals (e.g., seals) have crazy high myoglobin (or maybe it's hemoglobin?) content in their muscles, which makes the meat very dark red. Could be interesting to see what other oddities nature has made to muscle in extreme environments! Some bottom-of-the-sea-type fish could taste pretty interesting I'd guess.";45;305;193;818;484;58;566;46;359;89

When I find myself talking about cultured meat to people who are new to the topic, I often say something along the lines of ""it's the idea of using cells grown in a lab to make meat products that we usually get from animals. In the short term, this may be like using animal cells as ingredients to improve plant-based meat, and in the long term it might look like meat products that are 100% made from cultured cells."" I've recently become more and more attracted to the framing of ""cells as ingredients,"" since I think it handles that question pretty nicely and is also strikes me as a compelling way to explain it.";22;100;67;245;179;35;314;13;201;144

I can relate to what you are saying as I have been talking to a lot of people who are unfamiliar with the concept of cultured meat. One way I found this to be helpful is if I give them a high-level view of the science behind cultured meat. So this means explaining the 4 key steps: Cell Isolation, Cell Media, Scaffolds and Bioreactors. In every step, I try my best to explain the current state of the field. So for example, with cell scaffolds (my expertise), I make sure to give examples of plant-based scaffolds (tofu, spinach, alginate) and other such ""hybrids"" that you mentioned. Once people realize that cells need support and structure to grow on outside an animal, they get a clearer picture that the cultured meat products won't be 100% animal. At least that's what I felt from my 1-1 conversations. Btw, there is a way to control the degradation of these scaffolds so that we can actually have a 100% animal product.";18;64;33;81;117;0;200;4;151;51

Their theory is predicated on the observation that deforested land is unutilized for beef production and concluding that this is causal.
However its important to consider confounding variables. In the case of the amazon that's property rights. That's a huge topic on its own but suffice to say its not unreasonable to conclude that beef production is simply a byproduct of 'owners' clearcutting land for other reasons and using beef to offset costs.
In Brazil beef production is the #1 activity on cleared land but do you know what the #2 is? Soy, so if people went vegetarian overnight and beef's export value vanished what would happen is soy would replace beef as the 'leading cause of deforestation' since the underlying cause is not addressed.";13;100;67;245;54;58;223;4;50;89
